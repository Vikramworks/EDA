This project involves extracting bird observation data from an Excel file, performing data cleaning and preprocessing, and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) with data visualizations to uncover patterns and insights.
Title:

Bird Species Observation Analysis: A Comprehensive Study of Species Distribution and Behavior

Description:

This project delves into the analysis of bird species observation data, focusing on various key aspects such as data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Through this project, you will explore patterns in bird sightings, identify biodiversity hotspots, and study environmental factors influencing bird activity.

The analysis incorporates geographic insights, allowing for spatial analysis of species distribution, and species-specific investigations, such as identifying activity patterns, diversity metrics, and sex ratios.

Key skills honed in this project include data visualization, species analysis, SQL for data querying, and handling complex datasets to extract meaningful insights. This project not only offers a deep dive into ecological data but also provides actionable insights that can contribute to bird conservation and biodiversity protection efforts.

This title and description align with the skills you've mentioned and reflect the comprehensive nature of the analysis. It highlights the key areas of the project and how it benefits from various analytical techniques and tools.
